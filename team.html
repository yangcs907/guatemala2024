                <p>
                    I want to go to Guatemala this summer because of my connections to 
                    the same school from the previous year that I went. Similarly, my past 
                    experience has greatly convinced me of the need in the country, and how 
                    encouraging my presence can be to the students, especially the ones I bonded with. 
                    While my contributions to the ministry may be minute, I believe God can use me to 
                    show His love and goodness to the people in Guatemala, just as they bring glory to Him. 
                    Please pray for wisdom, the behavior and the example that we as a team set, organization 
                    of time, and the effectiveness of our testimonies and our ministry. Please also pray for energy, 
                    avoiding mosquito bites, and heat stamina!

                    This will be my first time going on this trip and serving with the ministry over there. 
                    I am very excited for what God has in store, and how He can use me to serve the people and community. 
                    Please pray for wisdom and a humble heart. Pray for focus, and that I can be a light to the students

                    I am thankful to our church for this opportunity to join the team at Man√° de Vida to serve the school children and their community in Guatemala. 
                    From volunteering with VBS over the years I know I enjoy children and helping them know about Jesus. Through volunteering with World Changers, 
                    I know I enjoy serving the community with my hands through hard work, even under hot conditions outdoors.
                    Please pray for me to know what to say to the people when I interact with them.
                    And also I hope that people will read the Bible to know more about Him.
