            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Our team will be spending a week serving at Man√° De Vida, a school in partnership with an organization
                called Tios For Hope, in Escuintla, Guatemala. The school brings hope to the impoverished community it
                serves, helping students to experience the transforming power of the Gospel through teaching, service,
                and discipleship, while also providing them meals and education and skills that gives them hope and
                ability to support themselves and their families -- breaking the bonds of sin and poverty for many!
                Tios For Hope invites groups from all over the world to engage students on the campus of Man√° De Vida,
                which is both a ministry and a K-12 school. Tios For Hope also provides mission teams additional
                opportunities
                to learn more about the culture of Guatemala, and spread the gospel through acts of service and
                evangelism.
                We will be one of the many teams that will have served at Man√° De Vida, with even some of our team
                members having
                served there before! We look forward to experiencing God‚Äôs provision, grace, and sovereignty while over
                there, and
                we are excited for meeting the students and forming relationships.
