        content: `
            Thanks be to God that we experienced minimal difficulty in the boarding process.
            At the airport in Guatemala City, we met with Mr. Herman Alb, and were able to give
            him the medicine Mr. Thy brought.
            Although the trip from the airport to Escuintla was a journey for the ages, we were 
            able to stop by a local restaraunt Pollo Campero for a quick lunch; the Lord blessed 
            us with abundant time to familarize ourselves with both each other and our main 
            communication with the school, Sra. Kayla.
            Upon arrival at the Casa around seven o'clock, we were met with a warm dinner and 
            wonderful rooming.

        content: `
            Praise the Lord for a successful first full day at Maná de Vida! We started off with a lovely 
            breakfast prepared by the staff, which was then followed by a presentation from Jose and Kayla, our
            primary coordinators. We learned about the history of Maná de Vida, and how it serves to spread God's Kingdom
            and provide a safe haven for many of the youth in Escuintla. Then, we headed towards the courtyard on
            campus where we were greeted by all of the students! It was truly a blessing as they each took turns giving us
            a hug and welcoming us into their community. It is not a stretch to say that we experienced more hugs this morning
            than any of us have experienced all year 😊. Afterwards, Yuchen helped teach a computer lab class, focusing on the
            basics of AWS cloud computing. Meanwhile, Albert, Chris, Joseph, and Luisa taught the eighth graders and the younger
            children through simple songs meant to help them learn English. Following the lessons, we led worship songs prior to 
            Pastor Nicholas' devotional on belonging, importance, and individuality in God's eyes. Again, the children gave us
            all hugs and we took pictures with the basketball boys championship team and the girls' soccer team. After lunch at
            the Casa, our team split into two groups for the home visits of the day; Albert, Chris, and Pastor Nicholas went to
            home of Caroline and her mother, Francesca, while Joseph, Luisa, Mr. Thy, and Yuchen went to Monica and Maria's
            house. We were blessed with the opportunity to hear about their testimonies and pray over them despite their dilapidated
            living conditions and their poor health. To end our group activities for the day, the Casa staff and Mr. Thy cooked
            a nice dinner for us, and lastly, we debriefed.
            <br></br>
            Overall, we are genuinely excited about being here and serving the students. We look forward to what the Lord has 
            planned for us to do tomorrow!

            The Lord is good! We had a fantastic day, beginning with leading the high schoolers in worship and Pastor
            Nicholas once again entertained the crowd with a lovely devotional about Zacchaeus. Additonally, Mr. Thy
            specifically took to the city to buy us supplies for his upcoming cooking plans. Afterwards, we helped
            serve lunch in the cafeteria by handing out meal components (like fruit snacks, courtesy of Mr. Thy) to the
            children. In this time, we were able to engage with some of the kids, like taking pictures and talking to 
            them. Soon after lunch in the Casa, Pastor Nicholas led another devotional for the faculty and staff at Maná
            de Vida, this time on Martha and Mary. Then, we came back to the Casa once more to work on the prayer garden; 
            although the work was arduous, the team had fun moving rocks from the garden wall. This work ended at around
            five o'clock, which gave us time to interact with some new guests at the Casa. Three siblings on their way to
            a retreat were able to stay and eat with us, and also sing worship songs in Spanish after dinner.

            Once again, thanks be to God! The day started bright and early with Mr. Thy's honest and touching
            testimony while we ate breakfast prepared by him and the staff. About seventy students arrived soon
            after, separated into four groups as to participate in four different activities; games with Albert
            and Yuchen, prayer with Pastor Nicholas and Mr. Bruce, worship with Chris, Joseph, and Luisa, and
            finally, writing cards with school faculty. Mr. Thy cooked a huge meal of Chinese cuisine for all our
            visitors, and the team got to sit at various tables to interact with the youth. In the afternoon, we
            helped the montessori class with their shelves by sanding down individual blocks of wood. To relax,
            members of our group went out to the Interplaza mall nearby in Escuintla. At the mall, we walked around 
            and went into several shops (especially technology ones, unfortunately 😅), and then finally ate at a
            bakery-restaurant called San Martin for dinner and a place named Sarita for dessert. The experience
            allowed us to see Guatemala in a less restricted environment, and we enjoyed the short time away from
            the Casa. Afterwards, we almost got lost on the way back, but thankfully God brought us back safely 😁🙏. 
            <br></br>
            We are looking forward to tomorrow, as we are headed to Antigua!
